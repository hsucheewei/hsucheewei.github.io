    <h1>Report: Large Coursework<br>
        Hsu Chee Wei</h1>

    <div>
        <h4>Introduction: What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose
            to
            implement?</h4>
        <p>My website is similar to that of a food blog/newsletter, providing readers with various topics related to
            food
            such as podcasts, recipes, restaurant recommendations and a self-guided food tour.
            The type of structure implemented is hierarchical, where the top of the page usually states briefly what the
            current page is about, which is then followed by more detailed information as the user scrolls down the
            page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Inspiration: State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers,
            websites,
            artists, blogs).</h4>
        <p>I personally enjoy eating Italian cuisine and discovering new places to dine at especially since the pandemic
            began, therefore I satisfied my wanderlust with restaurants since I'm no longer able to travel overseas
            which I
            normally enjoy doing. Hence, I have been looking at food reviewers more frequently lately in search of
            delicious
            food locally, which has inspired me to make my own website surrounding the topic of food.</p>

        <p>Two of my favourite food review blogs that inspired me are Eatbook and SETHLUI.com, where countless honest
            and
            informative reviews for places to dine at are published often.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Accessibility: State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different abilities and needs
            (for
            example those with visual impairment)</h4>

        <p>Lengthy content such as the menu under Reviews and recipe details have been placed into collapsible
            containers,
            which make it easier for users to navigate the page espeically on mobile. Otherwise, time would be wasted
            scrolling down if it is not the type of content that they are looking for. It is also easier on the user's
            eyes
            as the text will not clutter the page at first sight.</p>

        <p>The navigation bar is removed and instead replaced with a burger menu, making it easier for users with
            smaller
            screen resolutions to navigate the pages. In smaller screen resolutions, it may not be wide enough to
            contain
            all the buttons in the navigation bar and may make it hard to press due to the smaller size of the buttons,
            hence a burger menu makes it easier by vertically stacking the buttons and providing users with an option to
            show and hide the menu so that the page content is not obstructued.</p>

        <p>The website is responsive to various screen sizes using media queries. This provides accessibility to all
            devices
            so that content will be loaded properly according to their needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Usability: State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</h4>
        <p>Embedded maps are provided in the Tour page with waypoints of the stops so that users can conveniently
            refer
            to it to navigate their way
            while embarking on the self-guided tour.</p>

        <p>Menu consisting of the available items at the cafe is provided in the review page so that users do not need
            to
            search online and can easily see if anything appeals to them.</p>

        <p>Embedded podcasts are provided on the podcast page so that users do not need to waste time being redirected
            or
            change to the Spotify app in order to listen to the podcast.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Learning: state 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</h4>
        <p>I had to learn how to use the burger menu with the help of W3Schools, and adapted the code to my website
            according to my needs.</p>
        <p>I learned how to create collapsible content also with the help of W3Schools, however there were some minor
            inconveniences such as the content not fitting into the collapsible container, therefore I had to do
            troubleshooting myself and make it suited to my needs.</p>
        <p>I learnt how to use jQuery effects using W3Schools to create the sliding show/hide animation for "show
            more/less
            articles" in the food page. It would have been a lot of work to do it with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript but
            jQuery made it easily accomplishable with a few lines of code.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Evaluation I: What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?</h4>
        <p>I think the aesthetics and choice of colors makes the website look much more sophisticated and appealing. The
            sliding animations for collapsible content will also make the interface feel more interactive and smooth to
            users.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Evaluation II: What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another
            time?
        </h4>
        <p>I feel that the Recipes website could be further improved with a filter/sort function to make it easier for
            users to search for recipes depending on what they feel like making or arrange the recipes according to
            time/cost to make it.</p>

        <p>I also think that the comment pop-up under Recipes can be replaced with a text box built into the
            .post-interactions area so that it is much easier to utilise on mobile.</p>

        <p>If given another opportunity, I would certainly like to learn and implement these changes, which are key
            elements for a
            user-friendly website.</p>

        tools (you should also indicate inclusions from other sources within your code using comments)</h4>
